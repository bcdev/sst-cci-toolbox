Assessment-tool version 1.2 Manual
----------------------------------

The assessment tool processes Microsoft Word template files in docx format and replaces
variables in the template with parameters supplied in a file in Java Properties format
(key-value) pairs.

This software supports Windows and Linux operating systems.

Usage:

assessment-tool.bat/.sh [options]

Where options are:
    -o,--output <arg>       The output file name/path
    -p,--properties <arg>   The properties file-path containing the variables
    -t,--template <arg>     The word template file-path to use
    -r, --replace           Replace output file if existing

Properties file format
----------------------

The properties file format is described in detail at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties

The properties file contains key/value pairs defined in a single line, key and value are separated by '='.

One important key that has to be supplied defines the directory where image files are located:

    figures.directory  = /home/tom/scratch/pvir/figures

All other entries in the properties file are variable definitions that are explained in the next section.

Variables
---------

Variables in the word-document template are placeholders for content supplied by the assessment-tool. Variables in
the word document follow the convention

${variable_name}

Variables can be replaced by text or figures. When replacing variables, the formatting of the word-document is
not touched.

Variables in the properties file are stored as mere names, without the surrounding '${' and '}'.

The variable name has to follow a specific pattern that also defines the replacing functionality. A variable name
consists of a functional description, the name and an optional suffix, separated by a dot '.'.

Example:
    description.name.suffix

The functional descriptions are:

- word
    Replaces each variable occurence with the variable value, preferrably one word. Replacement happens in-line with
    the template text.
    Example:
        word.sensor = ATSR.2

- comment
    Replaces the variable occurrence with the variable value, creating a complete paragraph.
    Example:
        comment.Figure_2

- paragraph
    Replaces the variable occurrence with the variable value, creating a complete paragraph.
    Example:
        paragraph.summary_text

- figure
    Replaces the variable occurrence with a figure. The variable value must be an existing image file in PNG format,
    stored in the directory defined by 'figures.directory'
    Example:
        figure.dependence = atsr3-skin-raw-drifter-dependence-av1.png

- figures
    Replaces the variable occurrence with multiple figures. The variable value can be any wildcard-pattern defining
    an arbitrary number of images, stored in the directory defined by 'figures.directory'
    Example:
        figures.plot_lag_corr = lag_corr_*.png


Suffixes

- scale
    Allows to supply an optional scaling factor for the 'figure' and 'figures' descriptors. The default value is 0.2.
    Example:
        figure.dependence.scale = 0.45

- default
    Allows to supply a default value for any variable whis is used incase the variable is not set. This is an optional suffix.
    Example:
        paragraph.summary_text.default = TODO: we need to write something here


Wildcard expressions
--------------------

To define a list of figures, wildcard expressions can be used. Wildcards supported by the assessment tool follow the
"glob" filesystem command using (extended) Unix-style wildcards:

'**' recursively matches directories and sub-directories
'*'  matches parts or entire path names
'?'  matches single characters
character ranges expressed with '[]' will be correctly matched

Example:
    figures.plot_lag_corr = l?g_corr_*.png

Multiple wildcard expressions are supported, the expressions have to be defined in one line, separated by ';'.

Example:
    figures.plot_lag_corr = lag_corr_Daily*.png;lag_corr_My*.png
